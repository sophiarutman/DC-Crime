1423,"The ""Home PSA"" of all arrests for which a valid District of Columbia address was given are provided.  For all cases where the home address was outside the District of Columbia, the home address field was manually reviewed and marked as ""OUT OF STATE"". ""UNK"" is provided for cases where no address was reported.",,,
1424,"The ""Crime/Arrest PSA"" field contains the PSA associated with the original crime where the arrest record could be matched against the original crime report. For cases where the DC Moultrie Courthouse was indicated as the crime address (e.g., for Juvenile Custody Order, Failure to Appear, Fugitive from Justice, and Booking Order), ""COURT"" was listed as the crime PSA instead of PSA 102 (8% in JULY - DEC 2017).  For cases for which the Juvenile Processing Center (JPC) was indicated as the crime address ,or for cases where other processing locations were listed as the crime address (e.g., District station or MPD Headquarters), ""DISTRICT/JPC"" was listed as the crime PSA (4% in JULY - DEC 2017). For arrest cases without proper crime incident address, it was assumed that the arrest was made at the site of the crime, and the PSA associated with the arrest location was provided. (0% in JULY - DEC 2017)

5640,"The ""Home PSA"" of all arrests for which a valid District of Columbia address was given are provided.  For all cases where the home address was outside the District of Columbia, the home address field was manually reviewed and marked as ""OUT OF STATE"". ""UNK"" is provided for cases where no address was reported.",,,
5641,"The ""Crime/Arrest PSA"" field contains the PSA associated with the original crime where the arrest record could be matched against the original crime report. For cases where the DC Moultrie Courthouse was indicated as the crime address (e.g., for Juvenile Custody Order, Failure to Appear, Fugitive from Justice, and Booking Order), ""COURT"" was listed as the crime PSA instead of PSA 102 (8% in JAN - JUN 2015).  For cases for which the Juvenile Processing Center (JPC) was indicated as the crime address ,or for cases where other processing locations were listed as the crime address (e.g., District station or MPD Headquarters), ""DISTRICT/JPC"" was listed as the crime PSA (3% in JAN - JUN 2015). For arrest cases without proper crime incident address, it was assumed that the arrest was made at the site of the crime, and the PSA associated with the arrest location was provided.

9721,"The ""Crime/Arrest PSA"" field contains the PSA associated with the original crime where the arrest record could be matched against the original crime report. For cases where the DC Moultrie Courthouse was indicated as the crime address (e.g., for Juvenile Custody Order, Failure to Appear, Fugitive from Justice, and Booking Order), ""COURT"" was listed as the crime PSA instead of PSA 102 (13% in JAN - JUN 2015).  For cases for which the Juvenile Processing Center (JPC) was indicated as the crime address ,or for cases where other processing locations were listed as the crime address (e.g., District station or MPD Headquarters), ""DISTRICT/JPC"" was listed as the crime PSA (4% in JAN - JUN 2015).
